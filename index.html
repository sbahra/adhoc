	      Sasha will share with us her experiences optimizing the MongoDB storage engine
	      for modern fast storage devices. Sasha brings with her a wealth of experience
	      with significant contributions to NUMA, memory allocators,

              <h4>2. Making safe memory reclamation a feature of your memory allocator</h4>
              </p>
	      <p><b>Speaker</b><br>
              <a href="#">Jeff Roberson</a>
              </p>
	      <p><b>Summary</b><br>
              Jeff Roberson will share with us his experiences in the design and implementation
              of a novel safe memory reclamation mechanism that integrates directly into the FreeBSD
              kernel memory allocator. This is an alternative to RCU and epoch reclamation for many
              use-cases and is able to achieve 2X-6X better performance! Jeff has made significant contributions
              to open-source and is the author of the <a href="https://papers.freebsd.org/2003/BSDCon/jeff-ule_scheduler.files/jeff-ule_scheduler-paper.pdf">FreeBSD ULE scheduler</a>.

              <h4>3. A 15-minute history of task isolation on Linux</h4>

	      <p><b>Speaker</b><br>
              <a href="https://www.codeblueprint.co.uk/">Matt Fleming</a>
              </p>
	      <p><b>Summary</b><br>
                Many high-performance and real-time scenarios need to run
		tasks without interruption from either other tasks or the underlying
		kernel, and task isolation has been a common feature in RTOSes for
		years. Linux has improved its support for this use case for a long
		time and each improvement has brought the goal of running userspace
		tasks without interruption closer to reality. This talk will briskly
		cover the last 18 years of Linux kernel development relating to task
		isolation, finishing with the state of the art today and the latest
		version of the "task_isolation mode" patches on the Linux kernel
		mailing list. Expect some Linux kernel development history and
		explanation of kernel internals.<br><br>Matt is a senior
performance engineer at SuSE and has made several significant contributions
including improving <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190808195301.13222-3-matt@codeblueprint.co.uk/">Linux kernel scheduler performance by up to 20% for AMD EPYC</a>.

              <h4>4. jitmap, an execution engine for bitmap expressions</h4>
              </p>
	      <p><b>Speaker</b><br>
              <a href="http://github.com/fsaintjacques">Francois Saint-Jacques</a>
              </p>
	      <p><b>Summary</b><br>
jitmap is a small library providing an execution engine for logical binary
expressions on bitmaps. Some examples where this is relevant:<br><br>

* In search engines, posting lists (sorted sequences of integers) are encoded
  with bitmaps. Evaluating a search query (logical expression on
  keywords) can be implemented with logical expression on bitmaps.<br>
* In columnar databases, selection vectors (index masks) are encoded with
  bitmaps, the results of predicate on column expressions. The bitmaps are then
  combined in a final bitmap.<br>
* In stream processing systems with rule engines, e.g. adtech bid requests
  filtering with campaign rules, bitmaps are used as a first-pass optimization
  to lower the number of (costly) rules to evaluate on each incoming event.<br><br>

jitmap compiles logical expressions into native functions with signature
<code>void fn(const char**, char*)</code>. The functions are optimized to minimize memory
transfers via operator fusion and uses the fastest vector instruction
set provided by the host. Francois works full time on R Studio on Apache Arrow
and otherwise has worked on columnar database internals for several years now.
